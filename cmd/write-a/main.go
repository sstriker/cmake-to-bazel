// Command write-a is the production writer-of-A for the meta-project
// (Bazel-as-orchestrator) shape described in docs/whole-project-plan.md.
// It parses .bst element files, resolves their sources and dependencies,
// and renders project A (the meta workspace whose genrules invoke
// per-kind translator binaries) and project B (the consumer workspace
// built against project A's outputs).
//
// Phase 1 — kind:cmake only, single-element fixtures (hello-world.bst).
// Phase 2 (this file) — multi-element graphs + per-kind dispatch +
// kind:stack. Subsequent phases extend the kind set (kind:manual
// coarse-grained pipeline, then meson, autotools, ...) and the
// source-kind set (git, tar, remote-asset).
//
// Per-kind dispatch is mediated by the kindHandler interface (see
// kindHandler below); each kind's renderer takes the graph + a single
// element and contributes a per-element package to project A and/or
// project B as appropriate. Kinds that don't need an action-graph step
// (stack, filter, import, …) only contribute project-B starlark; the
// driver script's stage step is a no-op for them.
//
// Shadow-tree narrowing (kind:cmake):
//   - Default (no <element>.read-paths.txt sibling): every source
//     file is staged real. Conservative; matches pre-narrowing
//     behaviour.
//   - With <element>.read-paths.txt: include / exclude glob
//     patterns partition the source tree. Matched files stage
//     real; the rest stage as zero stubs (empty content via the
//     zero_files starlark rule). cmake's directory walks see the
//     entries; reads against zero stubs hit empty files. The
//     action input merkle is content-stable across edits to
//     non-included source files.
//
// CMakeLists.txt files always stay real regardless of the
// patterns — cmake parses the entry CMakeLists before any trace
// event could fire, so auto-including them keeps cmake configure
// correct.
