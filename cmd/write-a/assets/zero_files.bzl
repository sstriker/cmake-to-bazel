"""Materializes zero-length stub files at declared paths.

Used by the meta-project (project A) to compose per-element shadow
trees: a convert-element genrule's `srcs` is the union of real source
files (referenced via `glob(...)` or labels) plus zero-length stubs
for paths cmake's `file(GLOB)` walks would naturally see but cmake
configure doesn't actually open.

Why two reasons converge on the same primitive:

1. **CMake glob shape.** cmake's `file(GLOB)` records directory
   entries during configure. Hiding paths cmake's globs would walk
   shifts the generated graph (a glob that was supposed to match
   N files matches fewer). Zero stubs preserve the shape; cmake
   sees the entry, can't read content, but content was never
   relevant for a pure walk.

2. **Cache-key stability.** A convert-element action's input
   merkle includes the content of every declared srcs entry.
   Stubbing files cmake never opens means edits to those files'
   real content don't reshape the action key — cache hits across
   semantically-irrelevant edits.

The set of stubbed paths is determined per-element by inverting the
converter's `read_paths.json` output against the element's source
glob. The writer-of-A renders the resulting stub list into the
generated BUILD.bazel.
