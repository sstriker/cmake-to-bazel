# meta-hello.sh — Phase 1 acceptance gate for the meta-project shape.
#
# Drives the full two-pass pipeline against the hello-world fixture:
#
#   1. cmd/write-a renders project A (the meta workspace) and project B
#      (the consumer workspace).
#   2. bazel build in project A invokes convert-element via the per-
#      element genrule, producing BUILD.bazel.out + cmake-config-bundle.
#   3. The driver stages project A's BUILD.bazel.out into project B's
#      elements/<name>/BUILD.bazel (overwriting the
#      BUILD_NOT_YET_STAGED placeholder write-a rendered).
#   4. The driver writes a hand-authored smoke target into project B
#      (smoke/BUILD.bazel + smoke/smoke.c) that depends on the
#      converted cc_library and prints the library's hello message.
#   5. bazel build + bazel run in project B compiles and executes the
#      smoke binary; output is asserted to contain "Hello, World!".
#
# Cache-stability scenarios A and B are exercised inline after the
# initial round-trip succeeds, asserting both project A's conversion
# stability AND project B's downstream rebuild behavior.
#
# Bazel-availability gating: rendering checks always run; bazel build
# phases self-skip when no bazel >= 7 is on PATH (via META_BAZEL_*_ARGS
# documented below).

# META_BAZEL_STARTUP_ARGS / META_BAZEL_BUILD_ARGS let sandboxed dev

# Bazel splits flags into startup (between `bazel` and the

#     - Project A: convert-element cache-hits (zero_files makes the
#       genrule's input merkle stable across hello.c content changes).
#     - Project B: cc_library recompiles, since hello.c is in its
#       srcs. Smoke binary recompiles. This is expected; the win is
#       that A's conversion didn't re-run, so any sibling elements
#       that depend on hello-world's exports also wouldn't rebuild
#       (no sibling here, so the check is just A's stability).
#
#   Scenario B (edit CMakeLists.txt comment — IS in the read set):
#     - Project A: convert-element re-runs (CMakeLists is real),
#       but produces byte-identical output (cmake's parser strips
#       comments before the codemodel).
#     - Project B: cc_library + smoke do NOT recompile. CMakeLists
#       isn't in any cc_* rule's srcs, and the staged BUILD.bazel
#       (from A) is byte-identical, so the action keys downstream
#       are unchanged. Strictly stronger than today's orchestrator
#       semantics where any source-tree edit re-ran convert-element
#       AND triggered downstream rebuilds.
