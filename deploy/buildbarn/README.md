# Buildbarn validation deployment

A single-node Buildbarn instance for validating the orchestrator's
M5 (REAPI cache substrate) and M3b (REAPI Execute) paths against
real Buildbarn code, vs the in-process fake the unit tests use.

## Components

- `bb-storage`    — CAS + ActionCache (gRPC :8980)
- `bb-scheduler`  — queues Actions, dispatches to workers (gRPC :8983 client, :8984 worker)
- `bb-worker`     — pulls actions, materializes input roots, calls runner
- `bb-runner-bare` — exec's commands directly inside the shared build volume

No auth, localhost-only port mapping, file-backed blobstore at
1 GiB CAS / 64 MiB AC. Tear down with `docker compose down -v` to
wipe.

## Bring up

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/buildbarn/docker-compose.yml up -d
# wait for bb-storage healthcheck
until curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9980/-/healthy >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done
```

## Validate

Two acceptance gates depend on this stack:

```sh
make e2e-buildbarn         # M5 cache-share keystone (CAS+AC only)
make e2e-buildbarn-execute # M3b Execute keystone (full pipeline)
```

`e2e-buildbarn` runs the orchestrator twice against the fdsdk-subset
fixture, each pointed at `grpc://127.0.0.1:8980`; the second pass
must hit AC for every element and produce byte-identical outputs.

`e2e-buildbarn-execute` submits a synthetic Action through
`grpc://127.0.0.1:8983` (the scheduler's client port) and verifies
the worker actually exec's it and returns a populated ActionResult.
The synthetic action is a `/bin/sh` script — it does NOT exercise
the converter end-to-end, since the bb-runner-bare image doesn't
have cmake/ninja/bwrap installed. For full conversion through real
workers, build a custom worker image with the toolchain pre-baked.

## Tear down

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/buildbarn/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

`-v` removes named volumes so a re-run starts cold. Omit `-v` to
inspect a populated CAS across runs.

## Schema drift

Image tags in `docker-compose.yml` are pinned. When bumping them,
reconcile each `.jsonnet` against:

- [`bb-storage` blobstore.proto + global.proto](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/tree/master/pkg/proto/configuration)
- [`bb-scheduler` scheduler/scheduler.proto](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/bb_scheduler/bb_scheduler.proto)
- [`bb-worker` bb_worker.proto](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/bb_worker/bb_worker.proto)
- [`bb-runner-bare` bb_runner.proto](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/bb_runner/bb_runner.proto)

Test schema changes by running both make targets above against the
new images before merging.

## Production worker image (out of scope here)

bb-runner-bare exec's whatever command the action declares. For our
real conversion flow (`bin/convert-element ...`) the worker
container needs to provide:

- The bare runner binary (or any runner — bare is just easiest)
- `cmake`, `ninja`, `bwrap` at the versions encoded in the
  orchestrator's `--platform` / `defaultPlatform` properties
- `/bin/sh` (already present in the official image)

A simple custom Dockerfile FROM the runner image, layered with `apt
install cmake ninja-build bubblewrap`, would close the loop for full
end-to-end conversion. We don't ship that here because the platform
properties + version pins cross too many deployment-specific
concerns; the documented path is "build your own runner image,
update worker.jsonnet's platform properties, point the orchestrator
at it".
