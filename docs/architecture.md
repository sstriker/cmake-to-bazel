# Architecture

A descriptive map of what's actually in this repo today: the binaries
shipped, the data flowing between them, and the shared substrates each
one leans on. Not a plan — see `docs/m1-plan.md` … `docs/m5b-fidelity-plan.md`
for milestone framing and `docs/fdsdk-whole-project-plan.md` for what's
deferred.

## Goal in one paragraph

Take a BuildStream project (the FreeDesktop SDK is the working target)
and produce a Bazel build that builds the same artifacts. The pipeline
runs cmake against each `kind: cmake` element in a sandbox, reads
cmake's File API + ninja graph, lowers the result to an internal
representation, and emits both a `BUILD.bazel` (so Bazel can drive the
build) and a synthesized cmake-config bundle (so downstream cmake
consumers still resolve `find_package()`). Every element's outputs are
content-addressed in CAS; an orchestrator coordinates the multi-element
graph, materializes cross-element source/dependency trees, and
optionally submits the per-element conversion as a REAPI Action so a
remote Buildbarn cluster can fan out the work. Non-cmake element kinds
(`manual`, `autotools`, `meson`) are out of scope right now and tracked
in `docs/fdsdk-whole-project-plan.md`.

## The two binaries

### `convert-element`

Single-package converter. Given an extracted source root + cmake build
options, produces a directory containing `BUILD.bazel`, a
`<Pkg>Config.cmake` + `<Pkg>Targets.cmake` + `<Pkg>Targets-Release.cmake`
bundle, and a `manifest.json` describing the element and its outputs.

Pipeline, in order:

1. **CLI / hermetic setup** — `converter/internal/cli` parses flags,
   `converter/internal/hermetic` builds a `bwrap` argv that scrubs the
   environment to a known whitelist.
2. **`cmake --trace-expand` probe** —
   `converter/internal/cmakerun/run.go` drops File API query stamps
   into the build dir and runs cmake. The trace JSON is the
   read-path source of truth for the shadow-tree allowlist.
3. **File API replay** —
   `converter/internal/fileapi` walks the reply directory and parses
   `codemodel-v2` (targets, sources, link/compile fragments),
   `toolchains-v1` (compiler ID, flags, builtin paths), and
   `cmakeFiles-v1` (read-paths cmake itself relied on).
4. **Ninja graph** — `converter/internal/ninja/parse.go` parses
   `build.ninja` for the custom-command subset that the codemodel
   undermarks. Mostly used to fish out genrules.
5. **Lower** — `converter/internal/lower/lower.go` is the brain.
   It turns the typed File API + ninja outputs into
   `converter/internal/ir/types.go` (`Package`, `Target`, `Source`,
   `Genrule`, `ImportedTarget`). Most converter bugs land here.
6. **Emit** — `converter/internal/emit/bazel/emit.go` renders the
   IR as a `BUILD.bazel` (with `load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", …)`),
   and `converter/internal/emit/cmaketoolchain` /
   `converter/internal/emit/bazeltoolchain` emit the cmake bundle and
   the cc_toolchain rules respectively.
7. **Manifest** — `internal/manifest` writes `manifest.json` (sha256
   of every output, the toolchain fingerprint, the failure tier if
   any).

Tiered failures land in `converter/internal/failure/failure.go`.
Tier-1 (`unsupported-target-type`, `configure-failed`,
`unresolved-include`, …) means "this element can't convert; the run
continues without it." Tier-2/3 abort the orchestrator run.

`derive-toolchain` is a sister binary that runs cmake against a tiny
probe project and emits a `cc_toolchain_config.bzl` + `BUILD.bazel`
for downstream Bazel consumers, plus a `toolchain.cmake` that
pre-populates cmake's compiler-probe cache so per-element conversions
skip the expensive probe.

### `orchestrate`

Multi-element driver. Given a BuildStream project root and an output
directory, walks the element graph and runs one converter per
`kind: cmake` element in topological order, then writes a top-level
`converted.json` manifest.

Pipeline, in order:

1. **Element discovery** —
   `orchestrator/internal/element/project.go` reads the .bst files
   directly (no `bst` binary involved at this stage),
   `BuildGraph()` builds the dep DAG, `FilterByKind("cmake")` drops
   non-cmake elements onto the deferred list.
2. **Source resolution** —
   `orchestrator/internal/sourcecheckout` resolves each element's
   `sources:` spec to a local tree. Handles `local:`, `git:`, and
   `kind: remote-asset` (CAS-resolved). Caches under
   `--cache-dir`. `bsttranslate` is the offline cousin: rewrites .bst
   sources to `kind: remote-asset` so subsequent runs hit CAS instead
   of fresh git clones.
3. **Synth-prefix staging** —
   `orchestrator/internal/synthprefix/build.go` builds a per-element
   `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` tree from each dep's already-emitted cmake
   bundle. Creates zero-byte stubs at every `IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CFG>`
   path the bundle references so cmake's `find_package()` resolves
   without any actual built artifacts present.
4. **Per-element conversion** —
   `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/run.go:processElement` is the
   per-element worker. Two execution modes:
   - **Local** (default): `convertOne()` runs `convert-element` via
     `os/exec` against the staged source root.
   - **Remote** (`--execute`): `remoteExecute()` packages the
     element's input root into REAPI inputs, submits an Action via
     `internal/reapi`, and downloads outputs from CAS.
   Either way, the per-element output directory is then ingested via
   `internal/cas` so re-runs deterministically reuse outputs.
5. **Imports manifest** —
   `orchestrator/internal/exports/extract.go` parses the freshly-emitted
   `<Pkg>Targets.cmake` and folds it into a per-element imports
   manifest the converter consumes when it sees a `find_package()`
   that resolves to another converted element.
6. **Run-level manifest** — `converted.json` records every element's
   digest + status; consumed by `bazel/converted_pkg_repo.bzl` and
   `orchestrate-diff`.

Concurrency is `--concurrency` workers over the dep DAG; each element
waits for its deps' synth-prefix to land before it starts. The
50-element scale fixture under
`orchestrator/testdata/fdsdk-scale/` exercises this loop at
concurrency=1/8/32 and asserts byte-identical output across levels.

`orchestrate-diff` and `orchestrate-history` are post-run analysis
tools: diff compares two `converted.json`s and reports newly-failed
elements (exit 2 if any), history queries
`orchestrator/internal/regression`'s fingerprint registry to surface
churn or per-element drift.

## Shared substrates

### `internal/cas`

Local content-addressable store with an interface that matches the
REAPI CAS shape (`FindMissing`, `BatchUpdate`, `BatchRead`,
`Read`/`Write` for streaming). The orchestrator uses it both as its
own per-element output cache and as the staging area for inputs it
uploads to a remote Buildbarn.

### `internal/reapi`

Thin Action-submission layer. `Executor` is the surface
(`Execute(ctx, ActionDigest) → ActionResult`); `GRPCExecutor` talks
to a real REAPI Execution service. Input-tree construction and
output-blob download are the orchestrator's job — `reapi` doesn't
expose CAS or AC clients of its own; callers reuse `internal/cas`
for that.

### `internal/manifest`

JSON schemas for per-package `manifest.json` and run-level
`converted.json`. The bazel extension at `bazel/converted_pkg_repo.bzl`
reads these.

### `internal/shadow`

Path-only-stat shadow-tree creator. Mirrors the source root with
zero-byte stubs except for files matching the per-package allowlist
(default: `CMakeLists.txt`, `*.cmake`, `*.in`, `*.txt`, augmented per
package). cmake's `--trace-expand` JSON output identifies the
read-paths the converter actually saw, so a run's
`read_paths.json` records every file the conversion was sensitive
to. The `internal/shadow/trace.go` parser handles that; the per-
package allowlist registry lives in
`orchestrator/internal/allowlistreg`.

### `internal/fidelity`

Symbol-tier and behavioral-tier diff library. `DiffSymbols` compares
`SymbolSet`s extracted via `nm`/`objdump`; `DiffBehavior` runs a
test binary under both build paths and compares stdout/stderr/exit.
Used by `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/fidelity_e2e_test.go`,
which is the M5b acceptance gate (parameterized over fixtures —
hello-world for smoke, fmt for real-world). Not currently a runtime
gate on conversion — only a test.

## Downstream Bazel envelope

`bazel/converted_pkg_repo.bzl` is a bzlmod module extension. Given
the `converted.json` manifest path as an attr, it iterates the
elements and declares one `_converted_pkg_repository` per converted
element. Each such repository symlinks the element's `BUILD.bazel`,
its `cmake-config/` bundle, and the original `source/` tree into
the repo root, plus emits a synthetic `MODULE.bazel` and
`WORKSPACE.bazel` so the repo is loadable. Downstream `MODULE.bazel`s
just `bazel_dep()` rules_cc and `use_extension(":converted_pkg_repo.bzl",
"converted_pkg_repos").of_manifest(…)`.

The bazel-build downstream e2e
(`orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/bazelbuild_test.go`) runs the
orchestrator over the FDSDK subset, then `bazel build //:smoke`
against a downstream consumer that depends on a converted element.

## Build / test targets

`Makefile` is the dev surface. The shapes that matter:

- `make` — builds all five Go binaries into `build/bin/`.
- `make test` — unit tests (no cmake required; pre-recorded fixtures).
- `make e2e-hello-world` / `make e2e-fmt` — converter e2e against
  checked-in / fetched cmake projects (build tag `e2e`).
- `make e2e-orchestrate` / `make e2e-orchestrate-scale` — orchestrator
  end-to-end and 50-element scale gate.
- `make e2e-cmake-consumer` / `make e2e-bazel-build` — downstream
  consumer gates (cmake-side and bazel-side).
- `make e2e-toolchain-skip` — derive-toolchain integration gate.
- `make e2e-fidelity` / `make e2e-fidelity-fmt` — symbol+behavioral
  fidelity gate.
- `make e2e-buildbarn` / `make e2e-buildbarn-execute` — real-Buildbarn
  cache + execute gates (require docker compose).

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the CI surface. Four jobs: `unit`,
`e2e` (cmake+bwrap), `bazel-e2e`, `buildbarn-e2e`. Each step pipes
output into `/tmp/cijob.log`; the
`.github/actions/post-failure-tail` composite action posts the
last 150 lines to the PR on failure.

## Deployment substrate (local dev)

`deploy/buildbarn/docker-compose.yml` brings up bb-storage,
bb-scheduler, bb-worker, and bb-runner-bare. The runner is a custom
image (`deploy/buildbarn/runner/Dockerfile`) that layers cmake,
ninja, and bubblewrap onto upstream's distroless `bb-runner-bare`
at the versions the orchestrator's `defaultPlatform` declares
(currently 3.28.3 / 1.11.1 / 0.8.0). Per-service jsonnet configs
live in `deploy/buildbarn/config/`.

This stack is what `make e2e-buildbarn-execute` exercises. It is
the local-dev REAPI substrate; production deployments would point
the orchestrator's `--execute` flag at a real cluster.

## Where to start reading

If you're new and want a single thread through the codebase:

1. `converter/cmd/convert-element/main.go` — the converter pipeline
   in 80 readable lines.
2. `converter/internal/lower/lower.go` — where most converter logic
   actually lives.
3. `orchestrator/cmd/orchestrate/main.go` and
   `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/run.go` — the multi-element
   driver.
4. `bazel/converted_pkg_repo.bzl` — the bzlmod extension that makes
   converter outputs consumable by Bazel.
5. `orchestrator/internal/orchestrator/fidelity_e2e_test.go` — the
   e2e test that proves the whole stack produces the same artifacts
   cmake would.
